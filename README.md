# Disney Countdown

It's time to count down to the launch of RideTheTeacups.com! We are so excited to help you plan your family trip to Disneyland starting on November 9, 2019 @ noon MST.

## November 9th, 2019 @ Noon MST

This is a temporary landing page until the launch day is ready.

## What To Expect

Until launch day, you'll see some teaser content on this landing page, along with links to our social networks. Please subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq-ewlyHhOsuyVal6FG45yw), Like our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ridetheteacups), and get connected on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ridetheteacups/) TODAY!

When launch day hits and the counter reaches zero, the site will be moved into Maintenance Mode for a short time while the new site is uploaded. Downtime is expected to only take a few minutes. When everything is ready, the new site will launch automatically!

## Thank You

I sat down to create a counter for this landing page, but a quick search found an excellent working example from [Kristin Baumann](https://github.com/kristinbaumann). Thank you for the wonderful starting point! All of the timer logic came from her [wonderful repo](https://github.com/kristinbaumann/react-countdown). Please give it a star!

The amazing starfield comes from [Saransh Sinha](https://codepen.io/saransh). Give [his CodePen](https://codepen.io/saransh/pen/BKJun) a heart!
